# Minecraft Pack Manager

## Overview
Minecraft Pack Manager is a command-line utility designed to simplify the management of Minecraft mods, snapshots, and logs across different profiles. It facilitates creating backups (snapshots), copying mods between profiles, removing mods after gameplay, cleaning duplicate mods, and managing logs.

## Features

### Pre-Launch Operations
- **Snapshot Creation:** Prompted backup of the current mod setup before launching Minecraft.
- **Snapshot Viewing:** Option to open the most recent snapshot backup.
- **Mod Copying:** Copies mods from specified profiles to the primary Minecraft profile.

### Post-Exit Operations
- **Mod Removal:** Option to delete mods from the primary profile after exiting Minecraft.
- **Snapshot Viewing:** Review the latest snapshot backup.
- **Log Cleanup:** Removal of logs generated during gameplay to maintain disk space.

## Modules & Functionalities

### Handlers
- **Copy Handler (`copyHandler.js`):** Copies mods safely and logs the operations.
- **Delete Handler (`deleteHandler.js`):** Deletes mods from the primary profile's mods folder.
- **Duplicate Handler (`duplicateHandler.js`):** Identifies and removes duplicate mods.
- **Gather Handler (`gatherHandler.js`):** Collects mod data, detects duplicates, and processes mod files for snapshots.
- **Creation Handler (`creationHandler.js`):** Creates snapshots, computes differences, and maintains snapshot records.
- **Limit Handler (`limitHandler.js`):** Maintains the number of snapshots within a specified limit by deleting the oldest snapshots.
- **Open Handler (`openHandler.js`):** Opens the latest snapshot using the system's default text editor.
- **Cleanup Handler (`cleanupHandler.js`):** Cleans up logs from the primary profile.

### Main Script (`main.js`)
Initializes operations based on command-line hooks:
- `pre-launch`: Handles snapshot creation, snapshot viewing, and mod copying.
- `post-exit`: Handles mod removal, snapshot viewing, and log cleanup.
